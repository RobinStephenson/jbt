## Git Workflow
We will use the feature branch workflow. More information [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).

And remember:
* Keep the master branch clean.
* Submit pull requests before merging into branches you do not own.

## Style
We will comply with the Microsoft C# style guide available [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/ff926074.aspx).

## Pull Requests
A change should usually be reviewed by at least to other team members before it is merged into master. When reviewing a pull request ensure the code: 
* follows the above style guide
* has sensible names
* inlcudes tests for the happy and sad paths (sad paths are where errors happen).
* the tests pass
* has good documentation, especially docstrings
